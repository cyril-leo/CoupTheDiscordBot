# Start the game by explaining the rules to the players
print("Welcome to Coup! In this game, you are a powerful leader trying to outwit your opponents and hold onto your influence in the government. You will each start with two coins, and the goal is to be the last player with any influence left.

Here are the rules:

- Each player starts with two coins.
- On your turn, you can take one of the following actions:
    - Income: Take one coin from the treasury.
    - Foreign Aid: Take two coins from the treasury, unless another player challenges you and successfully proves that you don't have the Duke card.
    - Coup: Pay seven coins to the treasury and force another player to lose an influence (either by revealing a card or being eliminated from the game).
    - Tax: Take three coins from the treasury.
    - Assassinate: Pay three coins to the treasury and choose a player to lose an influence (either by revealing a card or being eliminated from the game).
    - Exchange: Discard one of your cards and draw another one at random from the deck.

- If another player challenges you and successfully proves that you don't have the card you claimed to have, you must reveal one of your cards (if you have any left) or be eliminated from the game.

- The game ends when only one player has any influence left. That player wins the game!
